\label{sec:guibuilder}

Overture has a feature for controlling a VDM model with a generic GUI,
automatically generated from the model~\cite{nunes&11}.\footnote{This feature is currently only
available for VDM++ models.} The generated GUI follows the same
principles as discussed in \autoref{sec:gui}. But rather than the user having to
implement the GUI himself, everything is automatically generated.
  In order to use the Generated GUI feature, simply launch the model
as a VDM  GUI configuration (see \autoref{fig:guibuilder-launch}).

Once the model has launched, the generic GUI will offer a list of all
classes allowing to create instances of each (see
\autoref{fig:guibuilder-instances}). These instances can then be selected to
inspect their state and invoke operations (see
\autoref{fig:guibuilder-account}). Any created instance or operation called will
be sent to the model, allowing to interact with it. Any responses from the
model are also shown in the GUI.
