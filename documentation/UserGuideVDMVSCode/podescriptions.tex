\begin{description}

\item[cases exhaustive:] If a cases expression does not have an
  \texttt{others} clause it is necessary to ensure that the
  different case alternatives catch all values of the type of the
  expression used in the case choice.

\item[finite map:] If a type binding to a type that potentially has
  infinitely many elements is used inside a map comprehension, this
  proof obligation will be generated because all mappings in VDM must be finite.

\item[finite set:] If a type binding to a type that potentially has
  infinitely many elements is used inside a set comprehension, this
  proof obligation will be generated because all sets in VDM must be finite.

\item[function apply:] Whenever a function application is used you need to be
  certain that the list of arguments to the function satisfies the
  pre-condition of the function, assuming such a predicate is present.

\item[function compose:] When using a function composition (f comp g), this ensures
    that the precondition of g implies the precondition of f applied to the result
    of g.

\item[function iteration:] When using a function iteration, for the function we
    are iterating with, this ensures that the precondition on an argument implies
    the precondition on the result.

\item[function parameter patterns:] When using a pattern as a function
    parameter, this ensures that all values in the parameter type for the
    function can match the pattern.

\item[function postcondition satisfiable:] Whenever a function has a post condition this checks that 
    the precondition of the function implies the post condition.

\item[function satisfiability:] For all implicit function definitions
  this proof obligation will be generated to ensure that it is
  possible to find an implementation satisfying the post-conditions for all
  arguments satisfying the pre-conditions.

\item[legal map application:] Whenever a map application is made you need to be
  certain that the argument is in the domain of the map.

\item[legal sequence application:] Whenever a sequence application is used you need to be
  certain that the argument is within the indices of the sequence.

\item[let be st existence:] Whenever a let-be-such-that
  expression/statement is used you need to be certain that at least one value
  will match the such-that expression.

\item[map compose:] When composing 2 maps, ensures that the
range of map2 is a subset of the domain of map1. 

\item[map compatible:] Mappings in VDM represent a unique relationship
  between the domain values and the corresponding range values. Proof
  obligations in this category are meant to ensure that such a unique
  relationship is guaranteed.

\item[map iteration:] When performing a map iteration, ensures the iteration
    count expression is either 0 or 1 or if it's greater than 1 then the map's
    range is a subset of its domain. 

\item[map sequence compatible:] When defining a map with enumeration, ensures that
    any two equal elements in the domain map to the same element in the range.

\item[map set compatible:] When merging a set of maps, any two equal elements in
    the domains of each map map to the same element in the range.

\item[non-empty sequence:] This kind of proof obligation is used whenever
  non-empty sequences are required (eg. taking the head of a sequence)

\item[non-empty set:] This kind of proof obligation is used whenever
  non-empty sets are required.

\item[non-zero:] This kind of proof obligation is used whenever zero
  cannot be used (e.g.\ in division).

\item[operation parameter patterns:] When using a pattern as an operation
    parameter, ensures that all values in the operation parameter type can
    match the pattern.

\item[operation post condition:] Whenever an explicit operation has a
  post-condition there is an implicit proof obligation generated to
  remind the user that you have to ensure that the explicit body
  of the operation satisfies the post-condition for all possible inputs.

\item[operation satisfiability:] For all implicit operation definitions
  this proof obligation will be generated to ensure that it is
  possible to find an implementation satisfying the post-condition for all
  arguments satisfying the pre-conditions.

\item[recursive function:] This proof obligation makes use of the
  \texttt{measure} construct to ensure that a recursive function
  will terminate.

\item[sequence modification:] Whenever a sequence modification is used, this
    ensures the domain of the modification map is a subset of the indices of the 
    sequence.

\item[state invariant:] If a state (including instance variables in
  VDM++) has an invariant, this proof obligation will be generated
  whenever an assignment is made to a part of the state.

\item[subtype:] This proof obligation category is used whenever it is
  not possible to statically detect that the given value
  falls into the subtype required.

\item[tuple selection:] This proof obligation category is used
  whenever a tuple selection expression is used to
  guarantee that the length of the tuple is at least as long as the
  selector used.

\item[type compatibility:] Proof obligations from this category are used to ensure that when constructing values of types that have an invariant actually live up to that invariant.

\item[type invariant satisfiable:] Proof obligations from this category are used
  to ensure that invariants for elements of a particular type are satisfied.

\item[unique existence binding:] The \texttt{iota} expression
  requires one unique binding to be present and that is guaranteed by
  proof obligations from this category.

\item[value binding:] When binding a value to a pattern, ensures that the
    resulting value matches the pattern.

\item[while loop termination:] This kind of proof obligation is a
  reminder to ensure that a while loop will terminate.
