\item[Semantics of Operators:]  \mbox{}

\begin{TypeSemantics}
Field select & yields the value of the field with fieldname {\tt i}
in the record value {\tt r}. {\tt r} must have a field with name
{\tt i}. \\ \hline
Equality\footnote{This equality is implicitly provided with the type. It is possible to override the primitive equality -- see Section \ref{eq}} & Structural equality over the record. That is, field-by-field equality, recursively applying equality to the constituent fields.\\ \hline
\end{TypeSemantics}
