\chapter{Validation of the translation rules}
\label{app:regression-tests}

\todo{Mention this chapter in ``About this report''}

Since the translation is not formally defined all the translation
rules have been validated by running examples, or \emph{regression
  tests}, through the tool. Each test consists of a \ac{vdmsl} model
that is used to test some aspect of the translation (such as a single
rule). Using the \ac{jml} translator each test model is translated to
a \ac{jml}-annotated Java program that is executed using the OpenJML
runtime assertion checker. The (actual) output obtained by executing
the generated Java/JML is then compared to some expected result to see
if the translation works as expected result.

This appendix contains all the regression tests that are used to test
the translation rules. For each test, the input model, the
corresponding Java/JML and the OpenJML runtime assertion checker
output is shown, respectively. Alternatively, all the examples,
including the generated output, can be downloaded
via~\cite{AllTestExamples}.
