\chapter{Validation of the translation rules}
\label{app:regression-tests}

Since the translation is not formally defined all the translation
rules have been validated by running examples, or \emph{regression
  tests}, through the tool (see \cref{sec:assess} for details). This
appendix contains all the regression tests that are used to test the
translation rules. For each test, the input model, the corresponding
Java/JML and the OpenJML runtime assertion checker output is shown,
respectively. Alternatively, all the examples, including the generated
output, can be downloaded via~\cite{AllTestExamples}.
