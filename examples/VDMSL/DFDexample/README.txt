This specification describes how one can automatically transform Data
Flow Diagrams (DFD) into VDM-SL definitions. It is written as a flat
VDM-SL model in a purely executable style. However, in order to test
it at the top level one needs to construct a large test structure
which essentially is an AST for a DFD. This have been done in the past
but unfortunately the sources for this have been lost. This model was
basis for a paper published as:

"A Formal Semantics of Data Flows Diagrams", P.G.Larsen, N.Plat, 
H.Toetenel, Formal Aspects of Computing'' 1994, Vol 6, December
