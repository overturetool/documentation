This example comes from the VDM-SL book by John Fitzgerald and Peter Gorm
Larsen. It is the running example through the chapter about logic. 
Suppose we are asked to develop the software for a temperature
monitor for a reactor vessel in the plant. The monitor is connected to
a temperature sensor inside the vessel from which it receives a
reading(in degrees Celsius) every minute.

The monitor records the five most recent temperature readings in the
order in which they were received from the sensor.
