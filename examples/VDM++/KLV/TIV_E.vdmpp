\section{The TIV\_E Class}

The TIV_E class represents the TIV_E beacon and implements the
abstract Beacon class. The instance variable represents the restricted
speed. A TIV_E beacon corresponds to a TIV_D beacon, and the
restricted speed is set by to the target speed of that announcement
when met. Set and get operations of the restricted speed exist.

\begin{vdm_al}
class TIV_E is subclass of Beacon

instance variables

  speed : [real] := nil;

operations

  public

  pure public
  getSpeedRestriction : () ==> real
  getSpeedRestriction () ==
    return speed
  pre speed <> nil;

end TIV_E
\end{vdm_al}
